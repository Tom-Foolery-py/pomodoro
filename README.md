# Pomodoro Clock

## Motivation 
A Pomodoro clock seemed simple enough to build on my own rather than using others. The key reason I wanted to do this was because a lot of the apps require users to log-in or provide information for use. I wanted more control over my own data in this regard. It also seemed like a learning opportunity for myself. I actually wanted to work on something else but got sidetracked on this project so that I can use it for a different project.

## Features
- Custom Command-line Pomodoro timer
- Bell alert notification using Pygame
- SQLite-based session logging (only completed work sessions)
- Subject tracking per session

## Next features
